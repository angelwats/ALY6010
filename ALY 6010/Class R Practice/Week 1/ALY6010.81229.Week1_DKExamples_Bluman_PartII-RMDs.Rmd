### R commands for standard normal distribution

#### Graphing Normal Distribution in R
```{r drawImage}
# hat-tip to J.R. for their answer on Stackoverflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27898931/how-to-shade-a-graph-using-curve-in-r
colorArea <- function(from, to, density, ..., col="blue", dens=NULL){
    y_seq <- seq(from, to, length.out=500)
    d <- c(0, density(y_seq, ...), 0)
    polygon(c(from, y_seq, to), d, col=col, density=dens)
}

curve(dnorm(x), from=-4, to=4, 
  main = "The Standard Normal Distibution", 
  ylab = "Probability Density",
  xlab = "Z")

colorArea(from=-4, to=qnorm(0.025), dnorm) # plot to left shading
colorArea(from=qnorm(0.975), to=4, dnorm, mean=0, sd=1, col=2, dens=20) # plot to right shading
colorArea(from=qnorm(0.4), to=qnorm(0.6), dnorm, col=5) # plot to middle shading

```{r bluman6-1-36_approxgraph}
curve(dnorm(x), from=-4, to=4, 
  main = "P(-0.20 < z < 1.56) Approximate Sketch", 
  ylab = "Probability Density",
  xlab = "Z")

colorArea(from=qnorm(0.4), # because 0.5 would be z=0, going a little lower for negative Z
          to=qnorm(0.7), # because 0.5 to 1 would cover 0 < z < 4, going a bit below mid-way (0.75)
          dnorm)
```

Or, given z, calculate p
```{r bluman6-1-36}
PvalHi <- pnorm(q = 1.56, mean = 0, sd = 1, lower.tail = TRUE)
PvalLo <- pnorm(q = -0.2) # shorten because defaults for mean, sd, and lower.tail are (0, 1, and TRUE, respectively)
pVal <- PvalHi - PvalLo
print(pVal)

curve(dnorm(x), from=-4, to=4, 
  main = paste0("P(-0.20 < z < 1.56) = ", round(pVal,4)), 
  ylab = "Probability Density",
  xlab = "Z")

colorArea(from=-0.2,
          to=1.56, 
          dnorm)
```

> Problem 6.1.44 (Bluman, pg 323)
>  Find the z-value for given area (aka p-value)
>  P(X > z) = 0.0239

```{r bluman6-1-44_approxgraph}
curve(dnorm(x), from=-4, to=4, 
  main = "P(X > z) = 0.0239 Approximate Sketch", 
  ylab = "Probability Density",
  xlab = "Z")

colorArea(from=qnorm(0.99), # because the probability is very small
          to=4, # because it is a greater than
          dnorm)
```

Or, given p, calculate z
```{r bluman6-1-44}
z <- qnorm(p = 0.0239,
           mean = 0,
           sd = 1,
           lower.tail = FALSE) # because we are giving area to RIGHT of z
print(z)

curve(dnorm(x), from=-4, to=4, 
  main = paste0("P(X > ", round(z, 2),") = 0.0239"), 
  ylab = "Probability Density",
  xlab = "Z")

colorArea(from=z, 
          to=4, # because it is a greater than problem
          dnorm)

> Problem 6.2.2a (Bluman, pg 337)
>  Teachers' Salaries
>   The average annual salary for all US teachers is $47,750. Assume that the distribution is normal and the standard deviation is $5,680. Find the probability that a randomly selected teacher earns
>   a. Between $35,000 and $45,000 a year

Step 1: Draw normal distribution curve and shade desired area.
```{r bluman6-2-2a_approxgraph}
curve(dnorm(x), from=-4, to=4, 
  main = "Approximate Sketch", 
  ylab = "Probability Density",
  xlab = "Z")

colorArea(from=qnorm(0.1),
          to=qnorm(0.4),
          dnorm)
```

Step 2: Find the z values
```{r bluman6-2-2a_step2}
mu <- 47750 # mean
sigma <- 5680 # stdev
# P(35000 < X < 45000) = ???  OR
xLo <- 35000
xHi <- 45000
zLo <- (xLo - mu) / sigma
zHi <- (xHi - mu) / sigma

# alternatively - we could write a function!
getZScore <- function(x, mu, sigma){
  return((x - mu) / sigma)
}

print("Comparing the calculation to the function, we get the same results.")
print(paste("Original zLo: ", zLo, "  Function zLo: ", getZScore(xLo, mu, sigma)))

print("However, order matters - getZScore(xLo, sigma, mu) gives different result")
print(paste("Original zLo: ", zLo, "  Function zLo: ", getZScore(xLo, sigma, mu)))

print("Unless you specify the parameter to argument matches:")
print("getZScore(xbar = xLo, sigma = sigma, mu = mu)")
print(paste("Original zLo: ", zLo, "  Function zLo: ", getZScore(x = xLo, sigma = sigma, mu = mu)))
```

Step 3: Find the p-value given the z-scores
```{r bluman6-2-2a_step3}
# now like example 6.1.36 - given z get p
PvalLo <- pnorm(q = zLo)
PvalHi <- pnorm(q = zHi)
Pval <- PvalHi - PvalLo

# and plot
curve(dnorm(x), from=-4, to=4, 
  main = paste0("P($35k < X < $45k) = ", round(Pval, 4)),
  sub = "given mu=$47.75k & sigma = $5.68k", 
  ylab = "Probability Density",
  xlab = "Z")

colorArea(from=zLo, 
          to=zHi, # because it is a greater than problem
          dnorm)
```


#### Applying the Central Limit Theorem
> As sample size n increases without limit, the shape of the distribution of the sample means taken with replacement from a population with mean mu and standard deviation sigma will approach a normal distribution with a mean mu and a standard deviation of sigma/sqrt(n) (Bluman, pg 346)


> Problem 6.3.22 (Bluman, pg 353)
>  Systolic Blood Pressure
>   Assume that the mean systolic blood pressure of normal adults is 120 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) and the standard deviation is 5.6. Assume the variable is normally distributed.
>   a. If an individual is selected, find the probability that the individual's pressure will be between 120 and 121.8 mmHg.
>   b. If a sample of 30 adults is randomly selected, find the probability that the sample mean [(xbar)] will be between 120 and 121.8 mmHg.

```{r bluman6-3-22}
# individual first
iLo <- getZScore(x=120, mu=120, sigma=5.6)
iHi <- getZScore(x=121.8, mu=120, sigma=5.6)
pValIndividual <- pnorm(iHi) - pnorm(iLo) 

# sample group

# define the function for z-score when applying the central limit theorem about a central mean
# assumes n >= 30!
getSampleMeanZScore <- function(xbar, mu, sigma, n) {
  return((xbar - mu) / (sigma/sqrt(n)))
}

sLo <- getSampleMeanZScore(xbar=120, mu=120, sigma=5.6, n=30)
sHi <- getSampleMeanZScore(xbar=121.8, mu=120, sigma=5.6, n=30)
pValSample <- pnorm(sHi) - pnorm(sLo)

print(paste0("p-val for individual: ", round(pValIndividual, 4)))
print(paste0("p-val for sample: ", round(pValSample, 4)))
```
