##Chapter 1
Age and weight examples:
```{r}
age <- c(1,3,5,2,11,9,3,9,12,3)
weight <- c(4.4, 5.3,7.2,5.2,8.5,7.3,6.0,10.4,10.2,6.1)

mean(weight)
sd(weight)
cor(age, weight)
plot(age, weight)
```
cor() gives the correlation coefficient value for any given x and y.

getwd() and setwd() should be used when creating R scripts to set the specific file paths and file locations.
dir.create() will create a new directory.

load() can be used to load a workspace in a current session.


##Chapter 3

```{r}
attach(mtcars)
plot(wt, mpg)
abline(lm(mpg~wt))
title("Regression of MPG on Weight")
detach(mtcars)
```
